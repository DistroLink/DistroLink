# DistroLink — V5 (Buttons, Pickup time field, Contact layout, Images)
- Buttons now use anchors **and** JS scrolling with a larger header offset — fixes "not working" behavior behind a sticky header.
- Pickup form replaces Start/End with a single **Time** field.
- Removed the Contact form; enlarged **Reach us directly** block.
- Local images guaranteed in `/assets/` and paths wired in CSS/HTML.
